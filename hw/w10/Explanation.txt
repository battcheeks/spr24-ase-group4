The observed explanation tax highlights that while explanations are aimed at simplifying complex information/ideas, it may overlook some crucial details within the data. This can lead to situations where the conclusions drawn from these simplified explanations are less accurate than those derived from a more detailed analysis of individual instances. Thus, we are making compromises when simplifying complex data into understandable rules. For example, the rule "Model < 71 and origin == 2 or origin == 3 and 71 <= Volume < 110" tells then about some specific filters applicable for that segment of data but it may fail to fully capture other intricacies of data. So, we should ensure that the rules generated cover all the important factors and avoiding misleading conclusions. Explanation tax is basically a reminder of trade-off that we are making between getting understandable rules and losing some details in the process.
